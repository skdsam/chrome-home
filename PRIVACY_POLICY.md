# Privacy Policy for Chrome Home

**Effective Date: January 17, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how **Chrome Home** ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you install and use our Chrome Extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently.

## 1. Data We Collect

We collect and process the following information to provide the core features of the expansion:

*   **Browser History (History Permission):** We access your recent browsing history locally to display the "Recent Sites" list. This data stays on your machine and is never transmitted to our servers.
*   **Geolocation (Geolocation Permission):** We request your location purely to provide accurate local weather data. This is only fetched when the weather widget is active.
*   **Top Sites (TopSites Permission):** We use this to populate the default shortcuts on your new tab page for a better initial experience.
*   **Storage (Storage Permission):** We use Chrome Sync storage to keep your shortcuts and settings consistent across your devices.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

*   **Customization:** To personalize your new tab with shortcuts and widgets.
*   **Weather Services:** To fetch localized weather updates.
*   **Functionality:** To allow the AI sidebar to link to your favorite AI tools.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not sell, trade, or rent your data.**
All data processing (like history and top sites) happens locally on your computer. Weather data requests are sent to third-party weather APIs, but no personally identifiable information (PII) is attached to these requests.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Our extension interacts with the following third-party services:
*   **OpenWeatherMap/Weather APIs:** For weather information.
*   **Unsplash:** For background images (if selected).
*   **AI Providers (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.):** Only if you choose to interact with them via the sidebar.

## 5. Security

We follow industry-standard security practices. Because we do not store your data on our own servers, the risk of a centralized data breach is eliminated.

## 6. Your Rights

You have full control over your data. You can:
*   Disable permissions in Chrome Settings.
*   Clear your local extension data in the Settings menu of Chrome Home.
*   Uninstall the extension at any time to remove all associated local data.

## 7. Contact

If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via our GitHub repository or support email.
